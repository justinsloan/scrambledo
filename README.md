# Scrambled-O!!
A Simple Word Scramble Game for Elementary Vocabulary Study

# What is it?
This is a simple word scramble game made for my second-grade daughter
to help her study for her spelling tests.  It uses a modified version
of John Zelle's graphics.py package to allow for Text Box lebel
objects to have a font size up to 64.  If you do not use the modified
version of graphics.py you will receive an "Invallid option value"
error.

# How do I use it?
The list of words to study should be put into a plain text file named
word_list.txt with one word per line and placed in the same directory 
as scrambled-o.pyw.
