# Scrambled-O!!
>A Simple Word Scramble Game for Elementary Vocabulary Study

***NOTE:** This is a Proof of Concept Prototype. While fully functional, the user interface and underlying code are not optimised and may not meet general user requirements or standards.*

# What is it?
This is a simple word scramble game made for my second-grade daughter
to help her study for her spelling tests.  It uses a modified version
of John Zelle's graphics.py package to allow for Text Box label
objects to have a font size up to 64.  If you do not use the modified
version of graphics.py you will receive an "Invallid option value"
error.

# How do I use it?
The list of words to study should be put into a plain text file named
word_list.txt with one word per line and placed in the same directory 
as scrambled-o.pyw.

When you run the program, you'll be presented with the options to "Start" a game or "Quit".  Click "Start" to begin and you will see your first word in scrambled form.  Type the word with letters in the correct order into the Text Entry box and press enter to check your answer.

If you answered correcty, you will see the message "GREAT JOB!!" on the screen. Simply presss enter on your keyboard to clear the Text Entry box and go to the next word.

If you answer incorrectly, you will see the message "Sorry, try again!" on the screen. Simply press any key on your keyboard to clear the message and try again.

This will continue until all words in the list have been unscrabled. The "Start" and "Quit" buttons cannot be used during a game. To quit the program during a game, click the close button (X) on the window.
